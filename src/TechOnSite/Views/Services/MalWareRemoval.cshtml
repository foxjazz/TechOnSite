            Viruses, Trojan horses,
            rootkits, worms, spyware and adware - collectively called “malware” (short for “malicious software”) -
            are common and significant issues for PC users. The problems they cause include annoying
            pop-ups, significant performance degradation, data loss, system instability and even
            complete system failure. Some malware present serious threats to financial
            or other sensitive data and
            personal privacy. Any malware issue should be considered potentially dangerous and
            eliminated immediately.

        <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">
            Many of our customers ask, “How could I possibly have a
            virus? I installed antivirus software.” The answer is that malware
            is software code written by malicious programmers, many of whom are
            very good at what they do. They find ways to circumvent antivirus
            protection to implement their attacks. Although most antivirus
            applications are quite effective, none are 100% capable of
            preventing all malware infections.&nbsp;
